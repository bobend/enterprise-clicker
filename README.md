# Enterprise Clicker: Rise to the Top

**Welcome to the Corporation.**

Here at The Corporation, we value **Synergy**. We value **Productivity**. We value **You** (as a depreciating asset).

Start your journey as a lowly Intern. Click the button. Do the work. Earn the currency. Buy the stapler. It is red. It is efficient.

## Features

*   **Career Progression:** Climb the ladder from Mailroom Clerk to CEO to [REDACTED].
*   **Asset Management:** Acquire helpful tools like Coffee, Fax Machines, and Soul Harvesters.
*   **Synergy:** Coordinate business efforts with Side Projects. Fund them. They are mandatory.
*   **Responsiveness:** Works on your desktop terminal and your pocket communicator.
*   **Audio Enhancement:** Enjoy soothing corporate beats that definitely do not contain subliminal messages from the Void.

## The Mission

Our mission is simple: **Growth**. Infinite, unbounded growth.

Do not ask where the money comes from.
Do not ask where the interns go.
Do not stare into the server room lights for too long.

*...why is the ticker saying that?*
*...why is the background moving?*
*...what is a "Blood Pact" and is it tax deductible?*

As your portfolio grows, so does your understanding. The numbers must go up. The Line must ascend. Reality is just another market to be cornered.

**CONSUME. INVEST. ASCEND.**
